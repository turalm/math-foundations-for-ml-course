        Consider an integral as function of $x$:
        $$F(x) = \int_{x_0}^{x} f(t) dt$$
    - text: |
        Apply definition of derivative to $F(x)$:
        $$F'(x) = \frac{F(x + dx) - F(x)}{dx}$$
    - text: >
        Substitute $F(x)$ into the formula:

        $$F'(x) = \frac{\int_{x_0}^{x + dx} f(t) dt - \int_{x_0}^{x} f(t)
        dt}{dx}$$
    - text: |
        Simplify the expression:
        $$F'(x) = \frac{\int_{x}^{x + dx} f(t) dt}{dx}$$

        Now, inside of the integral we have a volume 
        of a thin rectangle 
        with height $f(x)$ and width $dx$:
        $$F'(x) = \frac{f(x)dx}{dx}$$
    - text: |
        Simplify the expression canceling out $dx$:
        $$F'(x) = f(x)$$

        Therefore, the derivative of the integral 
        with $x$ as an upper bound is the original function:
        $$\frac{d}{dx} \int_{x_0}^{x} f(t) dt = f(x)$$
